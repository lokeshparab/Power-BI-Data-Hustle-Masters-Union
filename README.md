# Power-BI-Data-Hustle-Masters-Union

This hackathon project involved utilizing Power BI to extract valuable insights from the extensive IMDb Movies & Shows dataset. The objective was to identify and present the top 10 insights that provide meaningful and actionable information about the movies and shows in the IMDb database.

Using Power BI's powerful data integration and visualization capabilities, we first imported and cleansed the IMDb dataset. This involved cleaning up missing or inconsistent data, performing data transformations, and merging relevant tables to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
